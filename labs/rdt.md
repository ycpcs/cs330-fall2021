# Lab - Reliable Data Transfer   

###  R12.
Visit the Chapter 3 - Go-Back-N Java applet at the companion [Web site](https://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_kurose_compnetw_6/216/55463/14198702.cw/index.html).
- Have the source send five packets, and then pause the animation before any of the five packets reach the destination. Then kill the first packet and resume the animation. Describe what happens.
- Repeat the experiment, but now let the first packet reach the destination and kill the first acknowledgment. Describe again what happens.
- Finally, try sending six packets. What happens?

### R13.
Repeat R12 (all questions), but now with the Chapter 3 - Selective Repeat Java applet. List how are Selective Repeat and Go-Back-N different?
